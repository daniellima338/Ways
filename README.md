### **Design Choices**
As the property is located in the middle of the nature, I made all my design choices based on natural colors & elements.
I have used [Coolors](https://coolors.co/ "Coolors.co") and [Color Hunt](https://colorhunt.co/) to come up with a color scheme that fits the overall feeling of nature.

<a></a>
#### Fonts
In order to find appropriate fonts for my website, I have visited [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/ "Google Fonts") to explore the various options.
For the overall content I have decided to use the [Fanwood Text](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Fanwood+Text?query=fanw "Google fonts: Fanwood Text") font. In my opinion this font is easy to read and visually appealing.
For my headings I decided to go with a different font in order to make them stand out from the main content. The font I chose for this, is the [Eagle Lake](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Eagle+Lake?query=eagle "Google Fonts: Eagle Lake") font.
This is a calligraphic font that highlights to heading and gives it a more personal feeling. 

<a></a>
#### Icons
I have decided to implement icons, using the [Font Awesome library](https://fontawesome.com/ "Font Awesome"). The icons that I chose are self explanatory and are in line with the overall feeling of the website.
I will make sure that the icons are styled according to the website. I will use some icons to make the website more visually appealing but not to overtake the content.
The navigation menu will transform into a hamburger icon to make it more simple to use on mobile.

<a></a>
#### Colors
As mentioned before, I based my color scheme on the natural aspect of the property. 
You can view my color scheme [here](https://colorhunt.co/palette/193637).
Below I will explain more why I choose the various colors and for what I will be using them.

![Color Scheme](wireframes/color-scheme.png)

* #3C5D4B: This color will be used as my primary background-color. It is a dark green color (referring to trees, plants) which creates a calm, natural feeling. 
* #A1BAAF: This color is a slightly ligher green which I will use for my call-to-action buttons.
* #F6FFF8: This color will be used as text color for the overall contact of the page. It's a mint cream (off white) which stands out well to the background colors that I have chosen.
* #39210C: This is a seal brown color which represents the wood in nature. I will use this color as text-color for my call-to-action buttons. 
* #24382d: This is a slighly darker green than #3C5D4B that I used for the navigation bar and the footer. This way you can clearly see where the navigation bar ends and the rest of the website starts. 

I have used to contract checker on Coolors in order to make sure that the contract is sufficient.
This way my content will be easily readable. 

<a></a>
#### Structure
I have chosen to use [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) to create an overall structure for my website. 
Bootstrap provides various elements of CSS and Javascript which is very helpful to keep a good structure on your page. 
As Bootstrap is designed for mobile first, I will be certain that my website functions well on mobile.

## **Wireframes**
I have decided to use [Balsamic](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes/) to create wireframes for my website. 
First I created a basic wireframe for desktop and later on for tablet and mobile. 
For my website I have decided to go for a 1 page website which suits more with the current trends. 
The website will be easy to navigate by using the navigation bar or by scrolling down the page. 

You can find my wireframes below:

### [Mobile Wireframe](wireframes/mobile-wireframe.png)

## **Features**
<a></a>
### **Existing Features**

#### Navigation
For the navbar I have used Boostrap to create a responsive navbar. 
I have implemented as well the hamburger icon for mobile devices to be more user-friendly. 
In order to navigate more easilty through the site, I have implemented to scroll spy option from bootstrap to let the user exactly know where they are located on the site. 
For this to work properly I have fixed the navbar on the top of the page.


#### Hero Image

I have decided to implement a hero image which spreads over 100% width of the screen. In order to make the user curious about what follows next, I decided to set the height at 80vh so show a little peek of what comes next.
The image responds well when viewing on desktop, tablet and mobile.

#### Welcome Section

Here I used the grid from Bootstrap to create 3 colums on desktop view which turn into full width on mobile devices. 

#### Tree Houses Section

Here I also worked with the grid which was a bit more challenging. I implement 4 pictures who show all next to each other on desktop. 
On Tablet I have decided to hide 1 picture and on mobile I decided to hide 2 of the pictures and only show them after the introduction text of the tree houses.
In order to accomplish this, I used display: none and display: block when creating the columns. 

For the price section, I have a used a responsive pricing model instead of the normal table in bootstrap. 
I have worked with icons here to really show the difference between the 3 pricing models. 

Under the pricing model I have inserted a button which opens a modal with the current promotions. 

#### Gallery

For the gallery I have created a class which contains all the settings for position, size and height. 
Every image also got an ID where I added the background-image and in some cases I overwrote the position to be more appealing. 
I decided to not go with my original design like written in my wireframes as I had the feeling the images looked nicer having a full width on mobile instead 50%.

#### Testimonials

Here I also worked with the grid from bootstrap and as well some icons to make the section more visually appealing. 
Under the testimonials I have added the links to social media using icons which opens in a separate tab in the browers. 
This to make the website more user friendly.

#### Contact 
At the contact section I have provided contact and location details on the left. 
On the right I implemented a form which they can fill in if they would like to get in contact with the owners. 
Below the form there is a submit button which also triggers a modal to open up which gives feedback to the user that the form has been successfully submitted.


<a></a>
### **Features to be implemented**

* Interactive map for location with a link to google maps
* Direct booking module to increase direct bookings
* Whenever the form is submitted correctly, the information should be send to the email account of the property.
* Chat bot that links with the whatsapp of the property
* Links to external partners / companies like restaurants, activities in the neighbourhood, hike trails etc.
* Include information on how their data will be used (GDPR-Law)

## **Testing**

### Navigation bar

* **Plan**    
I want to include a navigation bar which will be fixed on top. 
While scrolling down the page, I want to give the user a clear view on where they are located on the site by using the scrollspy.
Whenever clicked on one of the navigation links, it should take you where you want to go.
To be more attractive and easy to use on mobile, I want the navigation bar to convert to a hamburger sign with a dropdown menu.

* **Implementation**   
I implemented the navigation bar using Bootstrap. This helps to give an overall structure and lay out to the navbar. 
I have used CSS to overwrite the default settings and making the navbar in line with the overall webite. 
In the body element I implemented the scrollspy and gave it an offset so whenever you click on one of the links, it shows the title with some spacing around. 
I have also used Bootstrap to implement the hamburger sign for mobile devices. 

* **Test**    
To test the navigation bar, I have click all the links to make sure it works properly. 
I have also opened the website in various browers (safari, google chrome, mozilla firefox) to make sure it works on all browsers and devices.
I also double checked the scrollspy on the various browsers and devices. 
On mobile the navigation transformed into the hamburger sign with a dropdown menu.

* **Result**    
The navigation bar shows nicely like expected on all browsers and devices. 
It did notice that the contact link was too close to the right side of the screen which I solved by increasing the margin. 
All the links work properly and the scrollspy gives a clear view on where you are located on the page. 

* **Verdict**    
The test has passed all the criteria and works like planned.

### Modals
* **Plan**    
I want to implement 2 modals which open up when you click on 'Check out our amazing promotions' and one for providing feedback when you submit the form correctly. 

* **Implementation**    
As I don't have the required skills yet to write JavaScript, I have used Bootstrap to include the modals on the website. 
I centered the modal vertically and horizontally as my overall website is centered and like this, it feels more like part of the website. 
I have used the same colors as my overall website by overwriting the standard css provided by bootstrap.
In order to center the title of the modal, I received some help from my mentor as I couldn't figure it out myself. 
By adding a width of 100%, I managed to center the title as well which made the modal more visually appealing.

* **Test**    
I have tested both modals on various devices and browsers. 
The modal was nicely centered and feels in line with the overall website. 
The promotion modal is being triggered by clicking the button and the submitting modal is triggered whenever the form was filled in correctly. 

* **Result**    
The modals opened up when the correct button was clicked and appeared centered on the screen.

* **Verdict**    
The modals works as planned and met all the criteria. 


### Contact Form 
* **Plan**    
I want to include a contact form which the user can fill in when they want to reach out to the owners directly.
They should insert their name, email address & phone number so the owners can easily get back to them. 
They should also be able include a message with the questions they are having. 
Whenever they submit the form, I want a modal to open up in order to give feedback to the user that the form has been submitted correctly.

* **Implementation**    
In order to implement this, I have created a form in my index.html with 3 input fields, 1 textarea field and a submit button. 
As it is a small & simple form, I have decided to not work with labels but placeholders instead. 
I made sure that the form was styled according to the rest of the website. 

* **Test**    
When I tested the form, I noticed that the modal opened up eventhough the form was not filled in. 
This gave the wrong feedback to the user. As I didn't have the required skills to implement form validation, I discussed this with my mentor. 
My mentor wrote a small part of JavaScript which I was able to implement in order for the form not being able to be submitted without the required fields being filled in. 
The data that is being inserted is currently not send anywhere as I don't have the knowledge yet but this is on the list with future features to be implemented. 

* **Result**    
After implementing the JavaScript, the form worked as planned and provided the correct feedback to the user.

* **Verdict**    
The form met all the criteria and works as planned.

### Bugs

#### Form validation

* **Bug**    
The user is able to submit the form without filling in the fields. Modal always appears. 
This provides the wrong feedback to the user.

* **Fix**        
As I don't have the required skills yet to implement form validation, I discussed this with my mentor. 
He wrote a small piece of JavaScript which I could implement in my code. 
Like this, the form couldn't be submitted without all the fields being filled in and the modal only opened whenever the form was submitted correctly.

* **Verdict**    
Bug was resolved and form now works as planned. 

#### Hero Image

* **Bug**    
The hero image looked nice on normal browsers but the quality on safari on mobile was very bad. 

* **Fix**    
Tried various fixes but none of them seemed to be working. 
After talking to my mentor, we changed the background-attachment to scroll on mobile and this resolved the bug. 

* **Verdict**    
Image now shows nicely on all devices and browsers.

#### Hamburger dropdown menu

* **Bug**    
On mobile devices when you click the hamburger icon, the menu appears nicely. 
Whenever you click on one of the links the dropdown menu doesn't dissapear but stays open. 
This is not a good user experience.

* **Verdict**   
I did various research to have this resolved but at this moment I don't have the required skills yet. 
This would be fixed in futher releases. 

#### Icons

* **Bug**    
The social media icons didn't show nicely on mobile. One appeared below the other 2 instead of all 3 next to each other.

* **Fix**    
Reduced the font-size and padding which resolved the issue immediately.

* **Verdict**    
Icons now show nicely next to each other on all devices and browsers. 

#### Navigation menu on smaller screensizes 

* **Bug**    
When the screen gets smaller, the fontsize of the navigation bar is too small and the collapse button goes off the screen. 

* **Fix**        
Removed the display: block and updated the width to 100% instead of 100vw like the assessor suggested. 
Updated the font-size as well in order to be more easy to read. 

* **Verdict**    
Bug was resolved and navigation bar now works as planned and is more userfriendly.

## **Credits**

### Content - Media - Inspiration

I have used the following websites to gather ideas and information for the overall content of my website: 

* [Herman Cottage](https://hermanncottage.com/)

* [Treehouse Point](https://www.treehousepoint.com/)

* [Quirky Accom](https://www.quirkyaccom.com/treehouse-holidays)

From the first 2 website I have also used most of the images for my website. 

I have used [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) for my hero image and the picture of the owners.

### Acknowledgements

First of all, I would like to thank my mentor Simen ([Eventyret_mentor](https://github.com/Eventyret)) for guiding me throughout this project. 
He helped me to brainstorm about ideas which were in line with my interests. 
During the mid review, he gave me a lot of tips in order to improve my code and to implement some other features in order to make my website more user friendly. 
I also want to thank him for helping with the form validation. I wanted to provide the correct feedback when submitting the form but I was lacking the skills for this. 
With his help, I was able to implement some JavaScript code in order to accomplish this.

I would also like to thank my partner Artur and my parents to provide honest feedback about the website and to put themselves in the shoes of the users.

I want to thank our Slack community as well. Whenever I had a doubt, I did some research on Slack and I always found someone who has the same issue as I did. 
This helped me a lot to get to the solution sooner. 

My inspiration I got mostly from runnning a bed & breakfast myself in Portugal a couple of years ago. 
This experience gave me some good insights of what owners expect from their website. 
As one of my passions is travelling, I also managed to put myself in the shoes of a potential guests.
